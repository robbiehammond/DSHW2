Calculated space of original document (assuming each character is 8 bits) = 8 * (total number of characters)
 = 37075 characters (found through iterating over each character in the input file) * 8 bits/character
 = 296600 bits

 Calculated space of encoded document = 1 * (total number of 0s and 1s)
 = 172152 0s and 1s (found though iterating over each character in the output file) * 1 bit/character
 = 172152 bits

 Calculated Savings: 296600 - 172152
 = 124448 bits (approx. 42% decrease)
